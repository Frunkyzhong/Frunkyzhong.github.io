I obtained my master's degree from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), advised by Prof. Rakesh Vohra. Before that, I got my B.S. degree with an honor in Computer Science from the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/) and B.A. degree in Mathematica.

You can find my CV here: [Zhongxiang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). 

Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. degree starting in the Fall of 2025.
